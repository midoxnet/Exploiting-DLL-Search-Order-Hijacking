# Privilege escalate from user to SYSTEM: Exploiting Windows 10 using DLL Search-Order Hijacking  
  
**Purpose of this repository**  
It is the purpose of this repository to: 
1) Inform how the Windows DLL Search-Order works and how it can be exploited. 
2) Show how it can be done by exploiting the svchost.exe-process to become SYSTEM. 
3) Publish .dll-file that can be used to test other processes for possible DLL Search-Order Hijacking vulnerabilies. 

This project consists of two files created in Visual Studio 2019.  
  
1) Test .exe: A x64-bit .exe-file with one purpose: To load the DLL file (has to be in the same directory as the .dll file). 
2) DLL-file: A x64-bit .dll-file with one purpose: Print the name of the user that is loading the DLL (i.e: System/user/administrator)
