# From user to SYSTEM: Exploiting Windows 10's svchost.exe using DLL Search-Order Hijacking  
  
## Purpose of this repository  
  
1. Inform how Windows searches for DLL files and how this DLL Search-Order can be used to escelate privileges.  
2. Show how to escalate privileges by exploiting the svchost.exe-process to become SYSTEM.    
3. Publish a .dll-file that can be used for further testing other processes for possible DLL Search-Order Hijacking  
  
  
**This project also consists of two files created in Visual Studio 2019.**   
1) Test .exe: A x64-bit .exe-file with one purpose: To load the DLL file (has to be in the same directory as the .dll file). 
2) DLL-file: A x64-bit .dll-file with one purpose: Print the name of the user that is loading the DLL (i.e: System/user/administrator)

## How does DLL Search-Order hijacking work?
